30) How to redirect stdout and stderr streams to log.txt file from script inside ?

Add "exec >log.txt 2>&1" as the first command in the script 
explanation： exec为自定义文件描述符；>log.txt 2>&1表示先将标准输出流重定向到log.txt，再将错误输出流重定向到标准输出流。
总结：该执行脚本内的 stdout & stderr 都将打到log.txt中
tip:
0 stdin
1 stdout
2 stderr

compare:
(echo 123;ls +) > log.txt
(echo 123;ls +) 1> log.txt
(echo 123;ls +) 2> log.txt
(echo 123;ls +) >& log.txt
(echo 123;ls +) > log.txt 2>&1
